This code performs value iteration, policy iteration and reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) on MDPs represented as grid worlds. To run the code, navigate to the 'BURLAP' folder in the terminal and run the 'ant' command to create the .jar file. Navigate back to the 'Solution' folder and run './Run.bat' from the terminal. If this fails, execute 'chmod 755 run.bat' then try it again. This .bat file runs easyGW.py, hardGW.py and varySize.py. These files output .csv files to the 'Solution' folder for each algorithm and .pkl files to recreate policies at important iterations for each algorithm as well. To construct the policy plots, run 'jupyter notebook "Policy Plots.ipynb"' from the terminal and run each of the cells in the notebook that appears. This assumes jupyter notebooks are installed on your machine. Finally, using R or RStudio, run the 'Plots and Analysis.R' file to get reward and time plots and explore statistics of each algorithm's output. Enjoy!
